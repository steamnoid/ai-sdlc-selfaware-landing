/** Build the page, and hand back where it landed.
 *
 * **A test of what the page says has to build the page.** Astro's frontmatter is
 * TypeScript run through Vite, so the only place a template's own arithmetic exists is
 * the built artifact. Testing the components would test Astro.
 *
 * **The suite must run with `--test-concurrency=1`, and this file is why.**
 *
 * Every page test swaps `src/state/the_family.json` into place, builds, and puts the directory back
 * as it found it. Two such tests at once are two builds writing one file, and the result is not a
 * failure anybody wrote a test for: `node --test test/*.test.mjs` without the flag produced
 * `ENOENT ... rename .astro/.prerender/_astro/index.css`, and a suite reported a failing *file*
 * while every individual test in it passed — because two builds were also sharing Astro's cache
 * directory. The serial flag is a constraint of this design, not a preference about speed, and it
 * lives in `package.json` where it is run by default.
 *
 * **The state is written only when a test asks for one.** A fresh clone has no state —
 * that is the point of it being a build artifact — so a test that wants to see the page
 * with a state writes one, builds, and removes it. Writing it into `src/state` is
 * deliberate rather than convenient: the page reads one path, so a state handed in
 * anywhere else would be a state the page never saw, and the test would pass against a
 * page that ignored it.
